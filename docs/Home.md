# Docs Wiki

This space mirrors the Markdown files under `docs/wiki/` and is synced automatically so that documentation changes ride along with code review. Use these pages to reference workflow details, desktop tips, and anything else that helps maintain the project.

## Getting started

- Make doc edits in the main repo under `docs/wiki/`.
- Open a pull request so the changes get reviewed like code.
- After merge, GitHub Actions copies the content here so the public Wiki stays current.

## Reference pages

- [[Wiki Sync Workflow]] — how the automation mirrors `docs/wiki/` into this Wiki.
- [[Kubuntu Default User Directories]] — what the standard Desktop/Documents/etc. folders do and how to rename or delete them safely.

Have another topic? Create a new Markdown file in `docs/wiki/`, add a link to it here, and it will show up on the Wiki after the next sync.
